664. Missing Numbers From 1 to N
Easy
https://binarysearch.com/problems/Missing-Numbers-From-1-to-N 

You are given a list of integers nums of length n where all numbers in the list
are from the interval [1, n][1,n] and some elements appear twice while others
only once. Return all the numbers from [1, n][1,n] that are not in the list,
sorted in ascending order.

Can you do it in \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time, modify nums in-place and use \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) additional space?

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
