https://binarysearch.com/problems/Max-Multiplied-Pairings

You are given two lists of integers nums and multipliers. Consider an operation 
where we remove any number in nums and remove any number in multipliers then 
multiply them together. Given that you must repeat this operation until one of 
the lists is empty, return the maximum sum of the multiplied numbers.

Note that the integers may be negative, zero, and/or positive.

Constraints

0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000 where m is the length of multipliers
